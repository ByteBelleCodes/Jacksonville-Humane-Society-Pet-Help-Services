Throughout the development of the Pet Help Center Case Management System, we gained a deeper understanding of how to plan, architect, and deliver a fully functional full-stack application from a real-world specification. This project challenged us to read complex requirements, break them down into actionable tasks, and validate each feature carefully. We strengthened our skills with React, Express, SQLite, and modern development workflows while also learning how to design clean data models, protect routes securely, and build robust ingestion and reporting pipelines. Implementing features such as case normalization, pre-upload editing, soft-delete/restore, admin management, and reporting gave us practical experience with full-stack integration and debugging across both the frontend and backend layers.

Collaboration was enhanced through the strategic use of AI tools. Microsoft Copilot supported the early phase of requirement breakdown and project planning, helping clarify expectations and reduce ambiguity. GitHub Copilot Pro acted as a coding assistant during implementation, improving our ability to iterate quickly, refactor cleanly, and troubleshoot errors efficiently. Instead of replacing our work, these tools amplified our learning—allowing us to focus on logic, testing, and feature correctness. Overall, this project strengthened our confidence in designing end-to-end systems, coordinating tasks, and using AI responsibly as part of a modern software development workflow

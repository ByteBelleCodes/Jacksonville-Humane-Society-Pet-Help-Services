The **Pet Help Center System (PHCS)** is a full-stack web application developed for the **Jacksonville Humane Society (JHS)**. It centralizes case management by ingesting data from fragmented external sources (voicemail files), providing a unified interface for staff to manage pet-related cases, track outcomes, and generate reports.
